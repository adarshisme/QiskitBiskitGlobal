We create a data set of Pauli Transfer Matrices by performing qauntum process tomography on randomized matrices under varying noise parameters. We then attempt to predict the noisy transfer matrix of a given channel and noise parameters using a weighted function as well as a non-linear neural network. Results are evaluated using fidelity.
